## Changing some important things
Navigate to `src/main/java` and rename the package and the .java File to your liking.<br>
Suggestion: "me.yourname.yourproject" (all lower case) and "ProjectName.java"<br>
Example: "me.thebusybiscuit.cooladdon" and "CoolAddon.java"

Navigate to `src/main/resources/plugin.yml` and change the "author" and "main" attributes.
You may also want to change the description to something meaningful.

Navigate to `build.gradle` and change the group id to "me.%Your name%".

Navigate to `settings.gradle` and change the value in `rootProject.name` to your GitHub repository name

After that you are good to go, you can now start developing your own Addon for Slimefun4.
